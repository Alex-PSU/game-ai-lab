# Prompt Engineering Process

## Programming
The programming for setting up the dnd agent wasn't too difficult. Most of the programming was already in the demo_agent.py and simply needed to be moved around (SEE: Structure). When looking at the code in a rookie in this field's perspective, as a friend said, the program seems to be more of setting the 'settings' for the Agent. As well as, of course, printing and saving the input and outputs. 

## The Big Issue: Structure
For my experience, the biggest issue I ran into was a very small issue--just something my brain didn't want to wrap around for some reason. This issue was the structuring of the program to get the '/exit' to work. This was simple, swapping the agent and user's position in the program structure. However, my brain just couldn't grasp that for some reason. 

## Notes for the Future
In my mind, the biggest ways to move forwards is trying to get the model to work within the rules of Dungeons & Dragons better. This is probably going to have to be giving it more information and prompts to get it to understand the system and work better. I want to have it run through character creation first, having it ask the user what they would like to do to make their characters, such as:
- Class
- Levels
- Background
- Ways of doing the stats (Rolled, Point Buy or Standard Array)

## Current Situation
There isn't much here as I got myself stuck on structure. And helping someone else with Github. Right now, it's just a basic prompt and roles.
