# Prompt Engineering and Templates Lab  

## Intro to Prompt Engineering
Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining prompts to improve the performance of language models. It involves crafting specific instructions or questions to guide the model's responses, ensuring that the output aligns with the desired outcome. This technique is crucial for maximizing the effectiveness of language models in various applications, such as chatbots, content generation, and data analysis.

## Introduction to Templates
Templates are pre-defined structures or formats that can be used to reuse well engineered prompts to generate consistent and coherent text. They provide a framework for organizing information and ensuring that the output follows a specific style or tone. 

## Lab Tasks
1. Edit `lab04_trader_chat.json` to create a prompt template for a DnD trader that successfully executes the trade. 
3. You can test your trader agent by running `lab04.py`.
4. Use Pytest framework in VSCode to ensure that it passes most of the tests in `lab04/tests/test_trader.py`
1. Sign your name in `lab04.py` to make your tests reproducible.
5. Show the status of some tests in VSCode to the instructor during the lab.
6. Upload a screenshot of status of tests in VSCode along with the commit hash in the textbox for for URL on Canvas.


## Lab04 Grading Rubric

1. __Status of Test Cases__: Measures how many test cases pass based on the prompt template created.
